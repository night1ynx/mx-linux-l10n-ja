"<p><b>General Instructions</b><br/>BEFORE PROCEEDING, CLOSE ALL OTHER APPLICATIONS.</p><p>On each page, please read the instructions, make your selections, and then click on Next when you are ready to proceed. You will be prompted for confirmation before any destructive actions are performed.</p><p>Core versions of antiX require about 1 GB of space, Base versions about 1.5GB and Full versions of antiX require about 3 GB of space. 5 GB or more is preferred.You can use the entire disk or you can put antiX on existing partitions. </p><p>If you are using PC type hardware, run GParted from here if you need to modify some partitions before doing a custom install. If you are using Apple hardware, you must never use parted or GParted on your boot drive. Instead you must setup your partitions and boot manager in OSX before installing antiX.</p><p>The ext2, ext3, ext4, jfs, xfs, btrfs and reiserfs Linux filesystems are supported and ext4 is recommended. </\n"
"p><p><b>Partition Requirements</b><br/>A linux-swap partition is highly recommended. Your RAM memory plus swap space must be at least 128MB. A larger size can improve system performance but you should not need more than 512MB of swap space unless you develop software or edit video files or run a database server.</p><p>A separate linux /home (pronounced home) partition is recommended and should be at least 200MB and preferably as large as possible. This is where your work will be stored. A separate home partition will make it easier to backup, upgrade or reinstall antiX in the future.A linux / ( pronounced root) partition is required. It needs to be at least 800 MB for Core versions of antiX and 1.5 GB for Base versions and 2.7GB for Full versions of antiX and it must be larger if you do not have a separate home partition. This is where additional applications will be stored and where the Linux kernel and drivers may be compiled. If you will be installing and/or testing a lot of applications, you should make this partition larger but, unless you test a lot software, it is unlikely you would need more than 5GB in this partition.</p><p><b>Auto-install Using Entire Disk</b><br/>The selected disk will be reformatted to ext4 and the installer will partition the disk as antiX prefers. Optionally you may request that a portion of the disk is left free if possible, for example so you can install a second OS later.</p><p><b>Custom Install on Existing Partitions</b><br/>antiX will be installed on the existing partitions you choose. If the disk isn't already partitioned appropriately, you can modify the partitions here with GParted.  If you have modified the partitions, it is best to reboot the system before continuing with the installation.  Do NOT use parted or GParted if you are installing on an Apple computer boot drive.</p><p><b>Upgrading</b><br/>To upgrade an existing Linux installation, choose to install on existing partitions and then choose to preserve the data in /home.</p>"

" a separate /home partition it will be easier for you to upgrade in the "
"future, but this will not be possible if you are upgrading from an "
"installation that does not have a separate home "
"partition.</p><p><b>Upgrading</b><br/>To upgrade from an existing Linux "
"installation, select the same home partition as before and check the "
"preference to preserve data in /home.</p><p>If you are preserving an "
"existing /home directory tree located on your root partition, the installer "
